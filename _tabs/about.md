Welcome to my blog which is essentially a place for me to document interesting, unique, or one-off findings in the journey of IT administration and PowerShell solutions, and hopefully of use to you.

I am a well-rounded Systems Administrator with a strong focus on Microsoft technologies, and an emphasis on PowerShell automation for Microsoft or non-Microsoft environments/platforms. While infrastructure is my core expertise, I am also very security-centric to protect people, data, and systems, to ensure efficiencies, uptime, and productivity (like the [PAW security model](https://aka.ms/CyberPAW)).

Some of my expertise lies in:

Typical on-prem:
* Windows Server
* Active Directory
* Group Policy
* Etc., etc.

Microsoft Cloud technologies:
* Azure Active Directory
* Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune & Autopilot)
* Exchange Online
* SharePoint Online
* and more...

**November 2021 Update** - I am attempting to revive this blog from its dormant phase, and add more interesting content to include Azure and MEM content.
