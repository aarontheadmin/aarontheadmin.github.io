#### Welcome to my blog
which is essentially a place for me to document interesting, unique, or one-off findings in the journey of IT administration and developing custom PowerShell solutions, and hopefully of use to you.

As a well-rounded Systems Administrator, I have well over 15 years with a strong focus on Microsoft technologies and an emphasis on PowerShell automation for Microsoft or non-Microsoft environments/platforms. While infrastructure is my core expertise, I am also very security-centric to protect people, data, and systems, to ensure efficiencies, uptime, and productivity (like using the [PAW security model](https://aka.ms/CyberPAW)). I also enjoy bridging gaps between disparate technologies.

Some of my expertise lies in:

* Azure Active Directory
* Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune & Autopilot)
* Exchange Online
* SharePoint Online
* Teams
* Windows Server
* Active Directory
* Group Policy
* WSUS
* Hyper-V
* macOS, Bash, AppleScript
* SDN network deployments
* Etc.

#### One of My Favorite Projects
was developing automation for multilingual (multitrack) live streaming, reaching a world-wide audience, using PowerShell, Bash, and AppleScript on macOS, to automate nearly 100% of the following:

1. Startup of live streaming events (with minimal input prompts).
2. Unattended shutdown driven by specified countdown timer or audio level.
3. Ship multitrack file to processing computer to:
  a. Create single tracks (per language).
  b. Create and tag MP3 and archive quality files based on metadata stored online.
  c. Upload all files and enable access for worldwide audience.
  d. Transfer multitrack file for backup.

**November 2021 Update** - I am attempting to revive this blog from its dormant phase, and add more interesting content like Microsoft Endpoint Manager and much more.
